# solid-guacamole
Yet another repository of shell scripts functions and latex gathered from all over the web. This could be accomplished with gists but that seemed like to much work and I allready find it hard to search through my own bookmarks. 

If you recognize the code and there is no attribution please feel free to add it in. I have tried to acknowledge all code but in many cases I was on a google hunt to solve issues and neglected to note sources.

Please take note, I am not a programmer and mostly bandaid others good work together to get the desired result. If something goes wrong, you have been warned!

### Notes:
+ I use macos running beta builds and have no access or idea if any of this works accross different platforms.
+ I have tried to keep this POSIX compliant based on shellcheck.
+ If shellcheck complained and I couldn't fix it (often) I disabled the error.

If some of these functions seem really simple it's because they are. When I write a shell script or latex document and get the desired behaviour I may not write another for six months. By that time I have forgotten even the simplest of things.
